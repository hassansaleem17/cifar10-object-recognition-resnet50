# cifar10-object-recognition-resnet50
This project leverages transfer learning with ResNet50, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, to classify 10 object categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes steps for model training, evaluation, and accuracy visualization, highlighting how pre-trained architectures can be effectively adapted for small-scale image datasets.
